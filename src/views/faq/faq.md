## 1. What is Keysians

Keysians is a decentralized crypto-asset lending and investment platform. The main goal of this platform is to improve the liquidity level of blockchain assets which are not highly liquidated. The lenders will not only earn from the interest but also will get KEN platform tokens. Similarly, borrowers will be able get stable tokens together with the KEN token. Hence, for every transaction KEN will be minted to be distributed to borrowers and lenders. This will enable platform participants to acquire staking dividends as well as governance, and other rights and interests.

## 4. The Transaction Fee at Keysians

1% of the loan amount is the fee that the borrower needs to pay to the platform and 10% of the interest earned by the lender is also a fee sent to the platform. The two transaction fees are taken after the order starts, and will be placed into the 'Dividend pool of transaction mining' in real time.

## 5. Rules of borrowing

#### 5.1 Details of borrowing order

1. The borrower chooses his ERC20 assets as the collateral and pledges it into the platform.

2. The borrower fills the order details including the loan amount, market, and amount of collateral, and so on.

3. The borrower should repay the loan before the order reaches the ending block. That is, if the borrower fails to repay after the ending block, the order will be placed into the 'Settling list'. Anyone who settles the orders not repaid for will get the KEN mining reward. The collateral assets then will be transferred to the investor, and the investor himself should be responsible for his investment.

------------

#### 5.2 Borrow amount

The amount of collateral and the corresponding loan amount are defined by the borrower.

------------

#### 5.3 Borrow interest

Interest rate is also defined by the borrower. The interest rate is in the form of annual interest rate by default, and the platform will automatically convert it back to the specific USDT amount. Borrower can directly fill in the certain USDT amount that he wants to borrow and the platform will convert it into the corresponding annual interest rate.

------------

#### 5.4 Borrow period

Block height is set as time reference on Keysians, and we will provide block height reference with the starting block and the ending block for loans. For example, if the borrower wants to borrow for 30 days, then the platform will convert such period into 'block height'. More concretely, 6500 blocks are generated per day (24 hours), so the ending block number will be current block + 6500*30.

------------

#### 5.5 About the split of borrow order

1. Orders will not be split by default on Keysians.

2. Borrowing stops whenever there is a successful lender, and the lender should take the order 100% rather lending any other percentage. Borrower should also repay 100% at one go rather than multiple times.

------------

## 6. Rules of lending

#### 6.1 Rules of borrower repaying and lending

*Repay successfully before ending block: collateral will be released back to borrower and lender get his USDT principle + interest.
*Fails to repay: Collateral will be released to lender.
*Liquidation(settlement): The borrower must repay before the order ending block, otherwise the collateral will face liquidation. At the time of liquidation, the collateral will belong to the lender, and the lender needs to bear the loss of the loan. Both sides should carefully judge the value of the loan collateral before the order beginning.

------------

#### 6.2 Rules of investment

When an investor accepts an order, the investor also accepts the benefits and risks of this order. When the value of the token suffers drastic fluctuations or the assets are liquidated because of overdue repayment, the investor shall bear the loss on its own and can handle the collateral to fill the loss by himself.

#### 6.3 Important notice before lending

Anyone can create and name any ERC20 token on Ethereum, which means there might exist multiple tokens with exactly the same token ticker(token name). Similar to any Ethereum explorer instancing Etherscan, this site can load any ERC-20 tokens via token smart contract address. Please do your own research and verify the smart contract address of the collateral token before lending.

## 7. Why borrow from Keysians instead of selling assets and using them for your next investment?

Selling your assets means that you will give up the future benefits if the assets price increases. A user can easily obtain liquidity (USDT) without selling assets, thus enriching the liquidity of his/her assets. By borrowing at Keysians, the user can participate in the process of mining (borrowing and lending) to obtain generous KEN incentives.
